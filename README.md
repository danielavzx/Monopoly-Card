Monopoly Card Layout

Overall, I utilized Visual Studio Code to code with HTML and CSS to create this card. I utilized the extension "Live Server" to view my image as I programmed incrementally. Therefore, I recommend utilizing the Live Server extension on VSCode when viewing my image. 

I would like to note that I included a black border around my outerbox because I wanted to show that I had it. When using Live Server, there was a white screen in the back and I could not differentiate my boxes from the white screen in the back. 

I would like to note that the code:

Thank you!
