Monopoly Card Layout

Overall, I utilized Visual Studio Code to code with HTML and CSS to create this Monopolgy card. I utilized the extension "Live Server" to view my image as I programmed incrementally. Therefore, I recommend utilizing the Live Server extension on VSCode when viewing my image. 

Thank you!
